Side Project #1: Flip Flop

Flip Flop is a web-based puzzle game developed with HTML, Bootstrap (CSS), and Javascript. No external library for game development is used in the making of this side project.

The game does not require any server to run on, hence it is able to be hosted with github page. The logic for the game is implemented with Javascript while the interface is implemented with HTML and Bootstrap.

Levels for the game will be updated regularly! So stay tuned :)

Early version of the game can be accessed through: https://vierivincent15.github.io/side-project-1-flip-flop/
